## Goals
1. Improve overall presentation of available pets for adoption at MACC for users.
2. Make finding/retaining information about available pets more streamlined than current version of site (ie. ability to e-mail pet information rather than having to remember Shelter ID's).

## Installation

1. Clone the project into your desired directory.
2. `cd lib/`
3. `bower install`
4. `npm install`

Then `cd ../` back to the root directory and:

5. Using a tool such as [npm http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), serve up the project. For npm http-server, you would type `http-server -p 8080` or whichever port you'd like to select.

## Under Development

Eventually, I would like to develop a view for staff/volunteers of MACC to be able to view adoption applications, volunteer applications, and posting/editing of pets' information, but I don't have the tools necessary to implement those features in a meaningful way at the moment.

## Contributing

Currently, this project is my Front End Capstone at Nashville Software School. I am unable to allow any contributions to be made at the moment.
